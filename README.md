Projects
1. Automation practices
    A collection of automation programs I made in my studies. Kept for reference purpose.

2. Omni KK Data ETL
    In my job as a Quality Engineer at Omni Remotes Cambodia, most of the data are in excel files. In order to simplify data manipulation and make use of Power BI, I designed an ETL process on the received reports. This system utilizes OneDrive, MS Power Automate, MS SQL Server, MS Power BI, Task Scheduler, and Python scripting. 

    Currently this project can update data daily as production reports come in, and update data on a specific date. It is planned to include scrap data and supplier to simplify cost reduction efforts later. However, the data source for the latter is WIP with support from OEM.
